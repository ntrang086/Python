"""Given two Integers N and M, and print all the terms of the series upto
M-terms of the N-bonacci Numbers. For example, when N = 2, the sequence
becomes Fibonacci, when n = 3, sequence becomes Tribonacci.

In general, in N-bonacci sequence, we use sum of preceding N numbers from the
next term. For example, a 3-bonacci sequence is the following:
0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81

The Fibonacci sequence is a set of numbers that starts with one or zero, 
followed by a one, and proceeds based on the rule that each number is equal
to the sum of preceding two numbers 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8â€¦

Examples:
Input: N = 3, M = 8
Output: 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13

Input: N = 4, M = 10
Output: 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 29
